## IASC 1P04

TelePort is an adventure game where the player explores an alien planet after being shoved into a portal, you can collect items, encounter aliens of different ages, and save or destroy people in an unfortunate situation. Teleport is inspired partially by Star Wars and Percy Jackson puts the player in a pressured situation and conveys the idea that selfish ideals can lead to big consequences.
